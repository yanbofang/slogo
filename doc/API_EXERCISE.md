SLogo Architecture Design
----------------------
1. Parsing takes place after a user types in characters and presses a button to confirm his input. This needs to occur before backend processes begin and it must start properly after pressing start. It will take place in the View class.
2. The result will be added to a RawCode object that will be passed down to Model.
3. Errors will be detected once Model passes the RawCode object to the ParseCode class. Here, the class will try to translate the RawCode to a Commands object, while doing so. If an error is detected, it will send an error back to Model then to View to be displayed
4. Commands will know what specific code is being implemented, they will know it during ParseCode, and they will spefically know from comparing strings with a resource bundle.
5. GUI will update once Command sends Coordinates to VIEW for the turtle to update with.

Create Your APIâ€™s:
Internal Frontend: RunSimulation
External Frontend: View
Internal Backend: Parse, command, History
External Backend: Model




## Use Cases:
1. The user types 'fd 50' in the command window, sees the turtle move in the display window leaving a trail, and has the command added to the environment's history.
	InputView -> View -> Model -> Parse -> Command and History -> createCoordinates -> Model -> view -> RunSimulation

2. The user types '50 fd' in the command window and sees an error message that the command was not formatted correctly.
	InputView -> View -> Model -> Parse, checkValid() false ->  Model -> View showErro()

3. The user types 'pu fd 50 pd fd 50' in the command window and sees the turtle move twice (once without a trail and once with a trail).

	InputView -> View -> Model -> 
4.  The user changes the color of the environment's background.
	InputView -> View -> Model -> Parse, readInput() -> Command, setBackground() -> Model -> View -> RunSimulation
