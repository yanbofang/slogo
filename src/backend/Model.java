/**
 * This class serves as the bridge between the backend and the controller, so none of the other backend
 * classes have to directly communicate with the controller. This class extends from the ModelAPI, which is
 * the 'contract' between the controller and the model. The main function of this class is to tell the backend
 * to handle input and to tell the backend to process commands. I think this shows good design because 
 * it eliminates dependencies between the parser and the commandHandler, which gives the two classes
 * very specific jobs.
